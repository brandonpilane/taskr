# `taskr` â€“ A Python CLI Task Tracker

A minimal, dependency-free command-line tool written in Python to track your to-dos directly from the terminal. Create, update, and manage tasks using simple commands â€” no database or external libraries required. Tasks are stored locally in a JSON file.

---

## Features

* Add, update, and delete tasks
* Mark tasks as **todo**, **in-progress**, or **done**
* List all tasks or filter by status
* Persistent local storage using `tasks.json`
* Zero dependencies â€” uses Python's standard library

## Why `taskr`?

Most task management apps are overkill for simple to-dos. `taskr` gives you the power of a simple tracker, accessible entirely via your terminal â€” fast, scriptable, and distraction-free.

## ðŸ›  Installation

### ðŸ”¹ Option 1: Install via `pip`

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/taskr.git
cd taskr
pip install .
```

Now you can use `taskr` as a command from anywhere:

```bash
taskr add "Write project README"
```

### ðŸ”¹ Option 2: Make it Executable Locally

1. Add the shebang to the top of `taskr.py`:

   ```python
   #!/usr/bin/env python3
   ```

2. Rename the file to `taskr` (no extension) and make it executable:

   ```bash
   chmod +x taskr
   mv taskr ~/.local/bin/
   ```

Make sure `~/.local/bin` is in your PATH.

## ðŸ§¾ Task Format

Each task in `tasks.json` includes:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "description": "Write unit tests",
  "status": "todo",
  "createdAt": "2025-05-06T14:00:00Z",
  "updatedAt": "2025-05-06T14:30:00Z"
}
```

---

## ðŸ§ª Usage

```bash
# Add a new task
taskr add "Refactor codebase"

# Update a task
taskr update 1 "Refactor and document codebase"

# Delete a task
taskr delete 1

# Mark a task
taskr mark-in-progress 2
taskr mark-done 2

# List all tasks
taskr list

# List by status
taskr list todo
taskr list in-progress
taskr list done
```
